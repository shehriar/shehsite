                <h1>RoadRover Rentals</h1>
                <h2>Angular, ExpressJS, SQL</h2>
                <p>Developed a website for a mock car rental service called "RoadRover Rentals".<br>
                    I used a dataset which contained data of over 500 vehicles, and implemented RESTful API endpoints
                    to connect the backend to the Angular frontend.<br><br>
                    The intuitive UI of the web application guides the user throughout the whole process,
                    from selecting dates and pickup location down to booking the vehicle.

                <h1>Pothole Detection System</h1>
                <h2>Flutter, Firebase, NoSQL, Jira</h2>
                <p>Created a navigation app which warns users of potholes on their route to allow<br>
                    for a safer journey. The application utilizes the Google Maps API to showcase a<br>
                    view of the streets and a line is drawn for guidance. The app is also community <br>
                    driven as the data is gathered through users reporting potholes as they spot it. 
                    <br><br>
                    The service also houses a Goverment Portal which allows government organizations<br>
                    to view the potholes in their communities, allowing them efficient data retrieval<br>
                    and ensuring that potholes are patched.
                    <br><br>
                    I developed this service with a group of 4, implementing the Scrum Agile methodology<br>
                    over a span of 3 months. Overall we completed 12 sprints and had 3 releases.

                <h1>Find Your Roof</h1>
                <h2>Technical Documentation and Planning</h2>
                <p>Find Your Roof is a development project which documents a thorough and strategic <br>
                    planning for an application which assists homeless individuals to find housing and <br>
                    employment opportunities. 
                    <br><br>
                    The application would be working with Non-Profit Organizations (NPOs) to set up a <br>
                    healthy environment to assist homeless individuals get back on their feet. This<br> 
                    would be done by scheduling workshops, connecting them with mentors, as well as<br> 
                    connecting them with potential employers and landlords.

                <p>Designed a card game similar to Poker but with a unique twist of handling 3 cards.<br>
                    The game utilizes multithreading to allow multiple players to independently <br>
